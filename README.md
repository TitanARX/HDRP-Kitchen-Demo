# HDRP-Kitchen-Demo

This project showcases my WIP interactive system I have been working on for sometime that allows customers to showcase products without crowding the screen with overlays 
and video. The environment, models and coding were done by myself. The basis for the project was a Webgl program I co developed last year for  a customer. 
This is an upgraded directors cut of sorts.
